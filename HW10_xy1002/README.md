# Homework 10 _ xy1002

For this homework I worked with Bailey, Dana, and Christian. We basically followed steps from the lab, and plot winter and summer City
Bike riders' plot side by side. From the plot we can conclude that there are more rides in the summer than winter, which makes sense since the cold weather. Also in the winter, the data can reflect more about the situation with riders in daily need since there are more tourist in the summer, and that can impact to the result. However, from the statistical reslut we can see the relationship between rides count and sptial lag dosen't really change seasonally.
