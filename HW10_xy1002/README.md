# Homework 10 _ xy1002

For this homework I worked with Bailey, Dana, and Christian. We basically followed steps from the lab, and plot winter and summer City
Bike riders side by side. From the plot we can conclude that there are more rides in the summer than winter, which makes sense since the 
cold weather. Also in the winter, the data can more reflect the situation with riders in daily need than tourist impact in the summer.
