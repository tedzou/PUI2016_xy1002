First she plot the absolute count, and this figure is in proper size which makes it easier to read. Meanwhile, the figure has resonable title, xy axsis lable, readable color bar and legend, and also correct caption that explains the figure.

The second figure is nomalized data from the last one. Same with the first one, it also has resonable title, xy axsis lable, readable color bar and legend, and also clear caption that explains the figure really well.


Overall, Loza did a great job for HW7.
