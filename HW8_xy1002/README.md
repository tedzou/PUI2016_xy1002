My server on compute was having this problem so I worked on my own local machine, and I download the data from NYC.gov using the link 
which is much smaller than the one on compute. I will change the data source to the large one after CUSP-IT reply me with the solution.

I worked with Trang Tran Linh Dam(ttd255) and Xubo Gao(xg656), we discussed with each other when we encountered difficulties, and discussed 
how to select the information that we need to get to the conclusion.
